#Prompt: with additional bpmn_metamodel_short.json file

This is a Metamodel. 
- A metamodel contains classes, relationclasses, attributes and ports, as well as multiple other properties. 
- Each attribute has an attribute_type.
- The classes array contains all the classes of a metamodel.
- A class has attributes.
- Each class has a universal unique identifier "UUID".
- The relationclasses array contains all the relations which are possible between classes. 
- Each relationclass has a universal unique identifier "UUID".
- A relationclass has attributes. 
- A relationclass has a role_from and a role_to reference which is a the UUID of a role. 
- A relationclass contains a roles array containing two roles which correspond to the role_from UUID and the role_to UUID.
- The role corresponding to the role_from is specifying the source role and the role corresponding to the role_to is specifying the target role. 
- Each role contains an array with class_references. This class_references define which class can be connected via the specific role.
- A class_reference contains a UUID which relates to a class from the classes array.
- A class_reference contains a min and max property which defines the cardinality of the relation. If the min is "null" and/or the max is "null", there is no cardinality restriction. 


Create a plantUML class diagram script for the provided metamodel. 
- include the classes from the metamodel classes array as classes in the class diagram.
- Include the relationsclasses from the metamodel relationclasses array as relations between the classes.
- It is possible that a class is connected via multiple relationclasses and roles. Consider all the combinations.
- including cardinalities to the relations based on the role_from and role_to.
- including directed relationsto the relations based on the role_from as start of a relation and role_to as end of a relation.
- if min or max is null, specify the name and direction of the relation, but do not specify the cardinalities.

Return the full plantUML script as text.

#ChatGPT Output:
The metamodel data from the JSON file describes a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram with various elements like classes, attributes, and relationclasses. To create a PlantUML class diagram script that reflects this metamodel, I will follow these steps:

Classes and Attributes: Define each class from the "classes" array in the metamodel, including their attributes.
Relationclasses and Roles: For each "relationclass" in the metamodel, identify the connections between classes. This includes specifying the source and target roles ("role_from" and "role_to") and handling cardinalities based on the "min" and "max" properties in the class references.
Cardinalities and Direction: Add cardinalities and direction to the relations, with special handling for cases where "min" or "max" is null.
Let's start by constructing the PlantUML script. ​​

Here is the PlantUML script that represents the BPMN metamodel based on your JSON file:

This script includes classes and their attributes, as well as the relations between them, including cardinalities and direction based on the role_from and role_to, as specified in the JSON file. You can use this script with any PlantUML tool to visualize the class diagram. ​
